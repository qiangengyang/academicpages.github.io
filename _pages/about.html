<h2>About</h2>
Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in <a href="https://www.ece.ufl.edu">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://www.ufl.edu/">University of Florida</a> and a research assistant at <a href="https://fins.institute.ufl.edu/">Florida Institute for National Security (FINS)</a> under <a href="https://damonwoodard.com/">Dr. Damon Woodard</a>. My research is focused on leveraging generative AI and natural language processing (NLP) to combat malicious online activities, including misinformation, phishing, toxic comments, gender bias, and malware. I investigate the human factors driving these threats and develop technical solutions to protect vulnerable users, such as children, teenagers, and the elderly. My work integrates interdisciplinary knowledge from computer science, engineering, mass communication, psychology, law, and politics. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of my expertise to tackle new and complex challenges.<br>

I am interested in doing a research internship. You are welcome to let me know of any opportunities via email or LinkedIn!<br>
