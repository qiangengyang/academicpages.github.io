Sharing and communication are necessary for human beings, a species of social animals. We all need mental support, consonance, and even debates to shape our minds and live together harmoniously. Here, I would like to share more about myself.


## üê± My Hobbies ##
In my free time, I keep some hobbies as my brain food.  


### üî† Language ###
I am a big fan of language. Culture represents a group of human beings, while language mirrors culture. What we are familiar with in our daily life traps us in information cacoons full of misunderstanding and bias, driving us to refuse different voices, and promoting social problems. The only solution is to keep open-minded and communicate with our fellow human beings, the little speck in the universe, and one of the best ways to get started is learning a new language, the key to the real world. 

Here are the languages I can use confidently:
* [**Mandarin Chinese**](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mandarin-language): My native language. There are numerous dialects of Chinese, and Mandarin functions as the standard to help people understand each other. As one of the most complicated and oldest languages due to the fruitful meanings of thousands of characters and changes of tones, Chinese features powerful rhythm and conciseness, which can be strongly represented through [poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_poetry).
* [**English**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language): I started learning English at 7 as it was a mandatory subject in school. I never struggled to learn, but I didn't fully practice my listening and speaking because those English classes normally focused on reading and writing for exams, and English is not a daily need in China. My English significantly improved when preparing for TOEFL and GRE for graduate school applications. After moving to the United States, I intentionally forced myself to practice English by reading news articles, listening to podcasts, and even randomly talking to strangers. 
* [**Cantonese Chinese**](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Cantonese-language): I taught myself Cantonese when I was an undergrad out of my affection for pop songs and movies from Hong Kong. It shares the same writing system with Mandarin, while its pronunciations are quite different as there are six tones and some unique pronunciations that do not exist in Mandarin. It is influential thanks to its common usage in Guangdong (or Canton, where it got its name) province, Guangxi province, Hong Kong, Macau, and many Chinese communities overseas. 

I found some of my talent in learning languages, and I'd love to learn as many languages as possible. Here are the languages I'm learning in my free time:
* [**Japanese**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language) and [**Korean**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language): These two are probably the easiest foreign languages for people from China, as the Japanese writing systems, including Kanji, Hiragana, and Katakana, are heavily based on Chinese characters, and the pronunciations and grammar of both Japanese and Korean are similar to Chinese. These two help me understand my native language from another perspective.
* [**Dutch**](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language): This might not be quite popular due to the small population of Dutch native speakers, but it is very similar to English, so it is a good choice for me to get familiar with [Indo-European languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages). 
* [**French**](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language): This is harder for beginners, but its subtle pronunciations sound beautiful. 
* [**Spanish**](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language): This is the most widely used language in [the Americas](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas). I'd like to try my best to pronounce [voiced alveolar trill](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_alveolar_trill) (I haven't made it yet, but I will announce here once I succeed!). Fun fact: if you understand English, Chinese, and Spanish, you can talk to over 80% of people in the world!
* [**Russian**](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language): I wish to learn more about the fruitful Russian culture. 


### üìñ Reading ###
Reading can always relax me quickly. Although I do not limit the topics to read, magic realism and life management are what I read the most. There are numerous great books, so reading widely is efficient unless the content is worth slowing down, thinking, and taking notes. 

Here are some of the books I'd recommend (update occasionally):
* [_One Hundred Years of Solitude_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/320.One_Hundred_Years_of_Solitude?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=njmy3UEmg2&rank=1) by [Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1982/marquez/biographical/)

### ‚úàÔ∏è Traveling ###
Reading keeps me in touch with the world mentally, but I also like to learn more about the world by traveling and feeling. It is costly but worthwhile. 
Here are some of the places I have visited and recommend (update occasionally):
* [Boston](https://www.meetboston.com/), MA, United States
* [Hongcun](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1002/), Anhui, China
* [Macau](https://www.macaotourism.gov.mo/en/), China
* [Chiang Mai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Mai), Thailand
* [Malacca](https://www.melaka-tourism.com/), Malaysia


### üéµ Music ###
Music is the universal language of mankind. I learned keyboard (thus a bit of piano as well) and [erhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhu) at a young age. I like classical, pop, indie, and country music. Here are some of my favorite musicians (update occasionally):
* [Fr√©d√©ric Chopin](https://www.youtube.com/@chopininstitute), Polish composer and virtuoso pianist
* [Lang Lang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0tK9F_6g2w), Chinese pianist
* [Arthur Rubinstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttLRonyyMak), Polish-American pianist
* [Coldplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j82L3pLjb_0), British rock band
* [Yao Beina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8MjP2t1zXw), Chinese singer
* [Sodagreen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuEja-aL1Uk), Taiwanese indie band



### üèÉ Sports ###
I like various physical sports, such as running, swimming, and playing basketball and table tennis. As for intellectual sports, I like playing [Go](https://www.britannica.com/topic/go-game), one of the oldest and the most complicated board games. Maybe you have heard of it because of [AlphaGo](https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphago) developed by Google DeepMind.  



## ‚ú® My Philosophy ##
My views are heavily influenced by [Daoism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/daoism/), [Chinese Buddism](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/09/21/6-facts-about-buddhism-in-china/), and [Confusianism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Confucianism). Although I only regard religion as another way to understand the world, I am interested in the ideas of any religion and absorb some of them into my worldview.

We can neither change the past nor predict the future as every success requires the satisfaction of multiple conditions, and hard work is only one of them. If we tried our best yet still could not make it, just let it go. The world is full of randomness, so there must be something not for us and something else waiting for us. Even if we were able to predict the future, such as who we would meet, when we would get a new job, and how much money we would make, life becomes boring to me because it is many surprising teeny-tiny things that make this journey full of excitement. 

We came to the earth, met each other, and created some wonderful memories. Eventually, we will die and the earth will vanish, just like we have never existed. Everything is unpredictable, so every second is cherishable, and even some undesirable experiences help us grow up. When I get old and look back on my whole life, what makes me regret would not be what I did but what I have never tried. 

In short, life is full of randomness, so I appreciate every second. The only meaning of my life is to experience. Live in the moment.

Just like what unpredictability means, my thoughts will also develop as my life goes on. I like to talk to different people to stay open-minded and absorb new ideas to shape my ideological framework. There are no right or wrong thoughts to me as long as they are within the range of ethics, although the concept of objective justice must exist in the wild for civilization. 

Here are some ideas that contributed to my views:
* [_The Butterfly Dream_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book)#%22The_Butterfly_Dream%22), a metaphor in [_Zhuangzi_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book)) by [Zhuang Zhou](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Zhuangzi)
* [Special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity) and [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity) by [Dr. Albert Einstein](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1921/einstein/biographical/)
* [_The Origin of the Universe_](https://www.hawking.org.uk/in-words/lectures/the-origin-of-the-universe), a lecture by [Dr. Stephen Hawking](https://www.hawking.org.uk/biography)
* [Karma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma)
* [_Memento Mori_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6181962/), a documentary
