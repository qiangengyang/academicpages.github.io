Sharing and communication are crucial for human beings as social animals. We all need mental support, consonance, and even debates to shape our minds and live together harmoniously. Here, I would like to share more about myself.


## üê± My Hobbies ##
In my free time, I keep a lot of hobbies as my brain food.  


### üî† Language ###
I am a big fan of languages. Culture represents a group of human beings, while language mirrors culture. What we are familiar with in our daily life traps us in information cacoons full of misunderstanding and bias, driving us to refuse different voices, and promoting social problems. To break the limitations and understand more about our fellow human beings, the little speck in the universe, one of the most efficient ways is to learn a new language. Language is the key to the door of the real world. 

Here are the languages I can use confidently:
* [**Mandarin Chinese**](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mandarin-language): My native language. There are numerous dialects of Chinese, and Mandarin functions as the standard to help people understand each other. As one of the most complicated and oldest languages due to the fruitful meanings of thousands of characters and changes of tones, Chinese features powerful rhythm and conciseness, which can be strongly represented through [poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_poetry).
* [**English**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language): I started learning English at 7 as it was a mandatory subject in school. I never struggled to learn, but I didn't fully practice my listening and speaking because those English classes normally focused on reading and writing for exams, and English is not a daily need in China. My English significantly improved when preparing for TOEFL and GRE for graduate school applications. After moving to the United States, I intentionally forced myself to practice English by reading news articles, listening to podcasts, and even randomly talking to strangers. 
* [**Cantonese Chinese**](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Cantonese-language): I taught myself Cantonese when I was an undergrad out of my affection for pop songs and movies from Hong Kong. It shares the same writing system with Mandarin, while its pronunciations are quite different as there are six tones and some unique pronunciations that do not exist in Mandarin. It is influential thanks to its common usage in Guangdong (or Canton, where it got its name) province, Guangxi province, Hong Kong, Macau, and many Chinese communities overseas. 

I found some of my talent in learning languages, and I'd love to learn as many languages as possible. Here are the languages I'm learning in my free time:
* [**Japanese**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language) and [**Korean**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language): These two are probably the easiest foreign languages for people from China, as the Japanese writing systems, including Kanji, Hiragana, and Katakana, are heavily based on Chinese characters, and the pronunciations and grammar of both Japanese and Korean are similar to Chinese. These two help me understand my native language from another perspective.
* [**Dutch**](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language): This might not be quite popular due to the small population of Dutch native speakers, but it is very similar to English, so it is a good choice for me to get familiar with [Indo-European languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages). 
* [**French**](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language): This is harder for beginners, but its subtle pronunciations sound beautiful. 
* [**Spanish**](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language): This is the most widely used language in [the Americas](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas). I'd like to try my best to pronounce [voiced alveolar trill](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_alveolar_trill) (I haven't made it yet, but I will announce here once I succeed!). Fun fact: if you understand English, Chinese, and Spanish, you can talk to over 80% of people in the world!
* [**Russian**](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language): My maternal grandfather could speak Russian when he was young. I am interested in the fruitful Russian culture. 


### üìñ Reading ###
I like reading widely and casually while relaxing myself. Although I do not limit the content I read, magic realism and life management are what I read the most. There are numerous great books, so the breadth of reading is more important than depth unless the content is important enough to slow down, think, and take a note. 

Here are some books I would like to recommend (update occasionally):
* [_One Hundred Years of Solitude_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/320.One_Hundred_Years_of_Solitude?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=njmy3UEmg2&rank=1) by [Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1982/marquez/biographical/)
* [_Cold Mountain_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10920.Cold_Mountain?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=q16uoIKTIQ&rank=1) by [Charles Frazier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Frazier)
* [_The Republic_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30289.The_Republic?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=FpvdVLP8mT&rank=1) by [Plato](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato/)
* [_The Social Animal_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203968.The_Social_Animal?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=srp5Mnnwmq&rank=2) by [Elliot Aronson](https://aronson.socialpsychology.org/) and [Joshua Aronson](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/joshua-aronson)
* [_The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness_](https://www.navalmanack.com/) by [Eric Jorgenson](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4029970.Eric_Jorgenson)

Some of my favorite writers include (update occasionally):

### ‚úàÔ∏è Traveling ###
Reading keeps me in touch with the world, but the best way to know more about the world is to travel, see, communicate, and feel by myself. It could be expensive, but it is worthwhile if applicable. 
Here are some places I have visited and highly recommend (update occasionally):
* [Boston](https://www.meetboston.com/), MA, United States
* [Hongcun](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1002/), Anhui, China
* [Macau](https://www.macaotourism.gov.mo/en/), China
* [Chiang Mai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Mai), Thailand
* [Malacca](https://www.melaka-tourism.com/), Malaysia


### üéµ Music ###
Music is the universal language of mankind. I learned keyboard (thus a bit of piano as well) and [erhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhu) at a young age. I like classical, pop, indie, and country music. Here are some of my favorite musicians (update occasionally):
* [Fr√©d√©ric Chopin](https://www.youtube.com/@chopininstitute), Polish composer and virtuoso pianist
* [Lang Lang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0tK9F_6g2w), Chinese pianist
* [Arthur Rubinstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttLRonyyMak), Polish-American pianist
* [Coldplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j82L3pLjb_0), British rock band
* [Yao Beina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8MjP2t1zXw), Chinese singer
* [Sodagreen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuEja-aL1Uk), Taiwanese indie band



### üèÉ Sports ###
I like various physical sports, such as running, swimming, and playing basketball and table tennis. As for intellectual sports, I like playing [Go](https://www.britannica.com/topic/go-game), one of the oldest and the most complicated board games. You have probably heard of it because of [AlphaGo](https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphago) developed by Google DeepMind in recent years.  



## ‚ú® My Philosophy ##
My views are heavily influenced by [Daoism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/daoism/), [Chinese Buddism](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/09/21/6-facts-about-buddhism-in-china/), and [Confusianism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Confucianism). Although I have no religious belief as I regard religion as another way to explain and appreciate the world, I am interested in the core ideas of any religion and absorb some of them into my worldview.

We can neither change the past nor predict the future, because every success requires the satisfaction of multiple conditions, including but not limited to hard work. If we tried our best yet still could not make it, just let it go. The world is full of randomness, so there must be something not for us and something else waiting for us. Even if we were able to accurately predict the future, such as who we would meet, when we would get a new job, and how much money we would make, life would become so boring because it is many surprising teeny-tiny things that make this journey full of excitement. 

We came to the earth, met each other, and created some wonderful memories. Eventually, we will die, the earth will die, and everything will vanish, just like we have never existed. Everything is so unpredictable, thus every second is cherishable, and even some undesirable experiences help us grow up. When I get old and look back on my whole life, what makes me regret would not be what I did but what I never tried. 

In short, life is unpredictable and full of randomness, so I appreciate every second. The only meaning of my life is to experience. Live in the moment.

Just like what unpredictability means, my thoughts will also develop as my life goes on. I like to talk to different people to stay open-minded and absorb new ideas to challenge and refine my existing ideological framework. There are no right or wrong thoughts to me as long as they are within the range of ethics, although the concept of objective justice must exist in the wild to regulate society.
